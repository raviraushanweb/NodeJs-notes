The console module in Node.js is primarily used for debugging and logging information in your applications. It's a built-in module, so you don't need to install any additional packages to use it. Let's dive deep into its features and methods.

1. Basic methods:

   - console.log(): Displays a message to the console (stdout) and appends a newline. It can accept multiple arguments that will be displayed as a space-separated string.
   - console.error(): Outputs an error message to the console (stderr) and appends a newline.
   - console.warn(): Outputs a warning message to the console (stderr) and appends a newline.
   - console.info(): Outputs an informational message to the console (stdout) and appends a newline. It's an alias for console.log().
   - console.debug(): Outputs a debug message to the console. The functionality of this method is similar to console.log(), but it's only displayed if the Node.js process is launched with the `--inspect` flag or the `NODE_DEBUG` environment variable is set.

2. Counting and timing:

   - console.count(): Logs the number of times this method has been called with the given label.
   - console.countReset(): Resets the counter for the given label.
   - console.time(): Starts a timer with a specified label. Useful for measuring the duration of an operation.
   - console.timeEnd(): Stops the timer with the specified label and logs the elapsed time.
   - console.timeLog(): Logs the elapsed time since the timer with the specified label was started.

3. Formatting and grouping:

   - console.assert(): Tests if a given expression is true. If not, it logs an error message.
   - console.dir(): Uses `util.inspect()` to display an object's properties in a readable format.
   - console.dirxml(): An alias for console.dir().
   - console.table(): Displays data in a table format.
   - console.group(): Creates a new inline group in the console log, indented by one level.
   - console.groupCollapsed(): Similar to console.group(), but the new group is initially collapsed.
   - console.groupEnd(): Exits the current inline group.

4. Advanced features:

   - Custom Console: You can create a custom console by using the `console.Console` class. This allows you to define your own output streams (stdout and stderr) and customize the behavior of the console methods.
   
   Example:
   ```JS
   const { Console } = require('console');
   const output = fs.createWriteStream('./stdout.log');
   const errorOutput = fs.createWriteStream('./stderr.log');
   const customConsole = new Console({ stdout: output, stderr: errorOutput });

   customConsole.log('This will be written to stdout.log');
   customConsole.error('This will be written to stderr.log');
   ```
   
   - console.trace(): Outputs a stack trace to the console at the point where this method was called. Useful for debugging.
   - console.clear(): Clears the console if the environment allows it. This method is not guaranteed to work in all environments.
