## Closure
A closure in JavaScript is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope. This is one of the key features that makes JavaScript such a versatile and powerful language.

A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
