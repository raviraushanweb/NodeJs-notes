## 1: Can you describe how the EventEmitter class from the 'events' module works in Node.js? What are some common use cases for this class?

**Answer:** EventEmitter is a class in the 'events' module of Node.js that implements the observer pattern. It allows objects to emit named events which cause previously registered listeners to be called. So, essentially, it's a mechanism for implementing asynchronous event-driven architecture.

Here is how you could create an instance of the EventEmitter class:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
```

You can then use the 'on' and 'emit' methods to handle events. For instance:

```javascript
eventEmitter.on('sayHello', () => {
    console.log('Hello World!');
});

eventEmitter.emit('sayHello'); // This will output: Hello World!
```

In this example, an event called 'sayHello' is registered using the 'on' method, and then the event is emitted using the 'emit' method, which causes the callback function to be executed.

The EventEmitter class is used widely throughout Node.js. For instance, it's used for handling HTTP requests, managing file and data streams, and even in built-in modules like 'fs' and 'http'. A common use case could be a web server where each incoming request might trigger certain events, which could be listened for and handled using the EventEmitter class. It's essentially the glue for managing async operations and callbacks throughout a Node.js application.

## 2: How does the 'once' method of an EventEmitter differ from the 'on' method, and why might you choose to use one over the other?

**Answer:** Both the 'on' and 'once' methods are used to register listeners for the events emitted by an EventEmitter instance in Node.js. However, they differ in the number of times the listener function is invoked when the event is emitted.

- The 'on' method, also known as 'addListener', registers a listener function that will be invoked every time the specified event is emitted. This means that if the event is emitted multiple times, the listener function will also be called multiple times.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

let count = 0;

eventEmitter.on('increment', () => {
    count++;
    console.log(count); // This will log 1, 2, 3
});

eventEmitter.emit('increment');
eventEmitter.emit('increment');
eventEmitter.emit('increment');
```

- The 'once' method, on the other hand, registers a listener function that will be invoked only the first time the specified event is emitted. After the event has been emitted and the listener function called, the listener is removed and will not be called again even if the event is emitted again.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

let count = 0;

eventEmitter.once('increment', () => {
    count++;
    console.log(count); // This will log 1
});

eventEmitter.emit('increment');
eventEmitter.emit('increment');
eventEmitter.emit('increment');
```

You might choose to use 'on' if you expect and want the event to be handled every time it's emitted. On the contrary, 'once' is useful when you only want to handle the first occurrence of an event. This is particularly useful for events that should only trigger a response one time, such as a user clicking a button to reveal a hidden section of the interface.

## 3: What is an 'error' event in the context of the events module, and how should it be handled? What happens if it is not handled?

**Answer:** The 'error' event is a special type of event in Node.js. It's associated with the concept of error-first callbacks, where the first argument to the callback function represents a potential error. This pattern is used extensively in Node.js to handle errors asynchronously.

Typically, when an error occurs during the execution of an EventEmitter, it emits an 'error' event. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

eventEmitter.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err.message);
});

eventEmitter.emit('error', new Error('Something went wrong'));
```

In this example, an 'error' event is emitted with an Error object. The listener registered for the 'error' event handles the error and logs it to the console.

If an EventEmitter emits an 'error' event and there are no listeners registered for that event, the Node.js application will terminate. This is because Node.js treats 'error' events as being exceptional (something that shouldn't normally happen), and if not handled, it's assumed there's a fatal error from which the application can't recover.

This is why it's important to always listen for 'error' events when working with EventEmitters, or use try/catch blocks when executing synchronous EventEmitter code to prevent application crashes.

## 4: Could you describe how the 'EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners' property works? What are potential issues with setting it too high or too low?

**Answer:** In Node.js, 'EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners' is a property on the EventEmitter class that sets the maximum number of listeners that can be added to an EventEmitter instance before a warning is printed to the console. This property is applied by default to all EventEmitter instances, unless 'setMaxListeners' is called on an instance.

The default value is 10. This means that if you add more than 10 listeners for the same event on the same EventEmitter instance, Node.js will print a warning to the console suggesting that you might have a memory leak. This is because adding an unusually high number of event listeners is often a sign of a coding error. Here's an example:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners = 20;

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
for (let i = 0; i < 21; i++) {
  eventEmitter.on('event', () => console.log(i));
}

eventEmitter.emit('event'); // This will print a warning about exceeding the maximum number of listeners
```

If you set 'defaultMaxListeners' too low, you may start to see these warnings even though there's no problem with your code. If you set it too high, you might suppress helpful warnings and risk not catching memory leaks.

It's important to note that this is just a warning, not an error. Node.js doesn't limit the actual number of listeners you can add. If you're sure that your application requires more listeners than the default, you can increase 'defaultMaxListeners', or call 'setMaxListeners' on the specific EventEmitter instance to change the limit for that instance alone.

## 5: Please explain the concept of 'Event Driven Programming'. How does Node.js and the events module support this paradigm?

**Answer:** Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads. These events are monitored by event listeners. When an event occurs, the corresponding listener function is triggered and executes the necessary actions.

Node.js inherently supports event-driven programming, mainly through its 'events' module, which provides the `EventEmitter` class. This class is used to trigger events and register listeners that react to these events.

In Node.js, when an event occurs, it gets placed into an event queue. The event loop, which is another important concept in Node.js, continually checks this queue and processes events as they arrive. This is done asynchronously, meaning that the program doesn't block other operations while waiting for an event to occur.

Here's a simple example using the 'events' module in Node.js:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Event listener
eventEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// Trigger an event
eventEmitter.emit('greet', 'Alice');
```

In this example, an event listener is set up to listen for 'greet' events. When such an event is emitted, the listener function is triggered, and the greeting message is logged to the console.

This paradigm is what makes Node.js highly scalable and efficient, capable of handling a high number of simultaneous connections with high throughput, which makes it perfect for real-time applications.

## 6: Explain what 'backpressure' is in the context of streams, and how does it relate to the events module?

**Answer:** Backpressure, in the context of streams, is a mechanism to handle the scenario when data is being pushed at a faster rate at the source (readable stream) than it can be handled/consumed at the destination (writable stream). 

Without backpressure, there's a risk that data can be pushed into the buffer of the writable stream faster than it can be written to the destination. This can lead to excessive memory usage and potential application crashes as the buffer grows without bound.

The events module plays a crucial role in managing backpressure in Node.js through the usage of events like 'drain', 'data', 'end', etc.

- The 'data' event is emitted whenever the stream passes a chunk of data to the consumer. The readable stream pushes data to the consumer whenever the 'data' event is emitted.
- If the writable stream cannot handle more data (i.e., its internal buffer is full), its 'write' method returns false, indicating to the readable stream that it should stop sending data for now.
- When the writable stream is ready to receive more data (i.e., data has been flushed from its internal buffer to the destination), it emits a 'drain' event. This signals the readable stream to start pushing data again.

Here is a simple example of how it works:

```javascript
const readableStream = getReadableStreamSomehow(); // Assume this is a readable stream
const writableStream = getWritableStreamSomehow(); // Assume this is a writable stream

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    if (!writableStream.write(chunk)) {
        readableStream.pause();
    }
});

writableStream.on('drain', () => {
    readableStream.resume();
});

readableStream.on('end', () => {
    writableStream.end();
});
```

In this example, if the writable stream cannot handle more data, the readable stream stops sending data. Once the writable stream is ready to receive more data, the readable stream resumes sending data. This is a basic demonstration of how backpressure is managed with the help of the events module in Node.js.

## 7: How would you implement a custom instance of the EventEmitter class? Could you describe a scenario where this might be beneficial?

**Answer:** Implementing a custom instance of the EventEmitter class allows you to add your own functionality on top of the existing EventEmitter methods and properties. 

Here's a simple example of how you could create a custom EventEmitter:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.greeting = 'Hello World!';
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(this.greeting);
        this.emit('greet');
    }
}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('greet', () => {
    console.log('Someone greeted!');
});

myEmitter.greet();
```

In this example, a `MyEmitter` class is created that extends the EventEmitter class. The `MyEmitter` class has a `greet` method that logs a greeting and emits a 'greet' event. You can then use instances of `MyEmitter` just like you would use instances of EventEmitter, but with the added 'greet' functionality.

Creating custom instances of EventEmitter can be beneficial in many scenarios. For example, you might want to create a custom HTTP server class that emits events whenever a request is received, a response is sent, etc. By extending EventEmitter, you can integrate this event-based functionality directly into your server class, leading to cleaner and more intuitive code.

## 8: What is the significance of the 'newListener' and 'removeListener' events in Node.js event handling? 

**Answer:** The 'newListener' and 'removeListener' events are special types of events provided by the EventEmitter class in Node.js.

- 'newListener': This event is emitted any time a listener is added to the EventEmitter instance. The event handler for 'newListener' receives two arguments: the name of the event and the listener function. This can be useful for logging the addition of new listeners, or for wrapping listener functions with additional functionality.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

eventEmitter.on('newListener', (event, listener) => {
    console.log(`Added a new listener for ${event}`);
});

eventEmitter.on('myEvent', () => {
    // do something
});
```

In the above example, when the 'myEvent' listener is added, the 'newListener' event is emitted and its handler logs the addition of the new listener.

- 'removeListener': This event is emitted any time a listener is removed from the EventEmitter instance. Similar to 'newListener', the event handler for 'removeListener' receives two arguments: the name of the event and the listener function. This can be useful for logging the removal of listeners or performing cleanup actions.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

const myListener = () => {
    // do something
};

eventEmitter.on('removeListener', (event, listener) => {
    console.log(`Removed a listener for ${event}`);
});

eventEmitter.on('myEvent', myListener);
eventEmitter.removeListener('myEvent', myListener);
```

In this example, when the 'myEvent' listener is removed, the 'removeListener' event is emitted and its handler logs the removal of the listener.

These events provide a way to observe changes in an EventEmitter's listeners, and can be very helpful in certain scenarios, such as debugging or dynamically altering the behavior of listeners.

## 9: In what order are listeners called when an event is emitted? How can you alter this order?

**Answer:** By default, listeners registered for an event are called in the order they were added (first in, first out). 

Here's a simple demonstration:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

eventEmitter.on('myEvent', () => console.log('Listener 1'));
eventEmitter.on('myEvent', () => console.log('Listener 2'));

eventEmitter.emit('myEvent');
// Output:
// Listener 1
// Listener 2
```

In this example, "Listener 1" is logged before "Listener 2" because the corresponding listener was added first.

If you want to alter this order, you can use the `prependListener` method instead of `on` when registering listeners. The `prependListener` method adds the listener to the beginning of the listeners array for the specified event, which means it will be executed first when the event is emitted.

Here's how you can use `prependListener`:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

eventEmitter.on('myEvent', () => console.log('Listener 1'));
eventEmitter.prependListener('myEvent', () => console.log('Listener 2'));

eventEmitter.emit('myEvent');
// Output:
// Listener 2
// Listener 1
```

In this example, "Listener 2" is logged before "Listener 1" because the corresponding listener was prepended.

## 10: How would you describe the `once` method of the EventEmitter class and when might it be useful to use?

**Answer:** The `once` method in Node.js EventEmitter class is a method that adds a one-time listener function for the event named eventName. The next time eventName is triggered, this listener is removed and then invoked.

Here's an example of how you could use the `once` method:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

eventEmitter.once('myEvent', () => {
    console.log('This will be logged only once!');
});

eventEmitter.emit('myEvent'); // Logs: "This will be logged only once!"
eventEmitter.emit('myEvent'); // No output, as the listener has been removed.
```

In this example, the 'myEvent' event is emitted twice, but the message is only logged once because the listener was registered using `once` rather than `on`.

The `once` method is useful when you want to ensure that a listener responds to a particular event only a single time. It's often used in scenarios where a particular event is expected to happen only once during the lifecycle of an application or an object (like the 'connection' event for a TCP server), and where handling the event multiple times could lead to undesirable effects such as redundant computations or incorrect program state.
